# Final Exercise - MJV School: Automated Testing

## Challenge

The challenge will be simple but with a certain level of complexity. The objective is to create code **using Page Factory and Cucumber** to automate **5 functionalities** of the website [phptravels.com/demo](https://phptravels.com/demo).

### Rules

- Create **5 scenarios for each functionality**.
- Each functionality must have its corresponding `.feature` file.
- It is not necessary to reuse code in all scenarios, but it is **mandatory** to reuse code at least **once per functionality**.
- Only the knowledge taught during the MJV School will be accepted.
- The capture of elements must be done **exclusively via XPath**.
- Validate each step using **asserts**. It is essential to validate the content of the automated elements.

---

Develop with a focus on the concepts learned, and make extensive use of **asserts** to ensure that the tests are well-validated. Good luck!
